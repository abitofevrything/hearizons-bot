It's for the Hearizons server. The function of Hearizons is basically split between two phases:
1. A submissions phase where people send links/names to their song they're submitting
2. The submitted songs are then assigned randomly to different people and everyone gives their review about it.

For the user it would look like this:
- They have a channel that they may send submissions in when the submissions phase is ongoing. The bot would then register that assignment and delete the message. The user is then locked out of sending further messages for that cycle. If they wish to change their submission, they can press a reaction to remove their submission and they would be able to send a message again. The channel is closed whenever submissions are not open.
- The bot then randomly distributes the songs to each participant and gives a role to each participant. When the participant gives their review in the #review channel (on Hearizons it's #official-comments") they lose the role and are unable to send a message.
- If someone hasn't reviewed their assigned song they would be locked out from further submissions until they review the song.

For us (the admins) the following would be nice:
- Be able to extend a phase's duration
- Browse current submissions
- Re-randomize the assignments
- Remove a participant's submission

Also if possible it would be nice to be able to run 2 cycles at the same time but that's not mandatory (e.g normal cycle (with songs) coexisting with special cycle (albums))
